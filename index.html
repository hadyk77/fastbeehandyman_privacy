    <p dir="ltr"><strong>For Internal Purposes.</strong> We may use the information we collect for our internal business
        purposes, for example, to manage the content of our websites or to assess the amount of online traffic to our
        websites. Fastbee HandyMan may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our visitors, traffic patterns and
        related website usage information. This data reflects website usage patterns gathered during hundreds or

        communications from us to provide you with our Services, provide updates, or to respond to inquiries made

        you and a driver or provider of the Services, such as clarification of geographical location, pick up time, and
        so forth. With respect to users who maintain a corporate business account with us, we may use the contact

        mobile apps cannot access without your consent. The first time our mobile app wants to access your data, the iOS

        An Android device will notify you that our mobile app wants to access your data before you first use the app,
        then your subsequent use of the app constitutes your consent.</p>

        Internet. SSL technology encrypts your information before it is transmitted to help protect it from being
        decoded. It is the standard method of communicating and securing online transactions and is built into most
        commonly used browsers.</p>

        and use your password when you log in to our Services. We will not ask for your password in any unsolicited

        recommendations: (a) do not reveal your password to anyone and keep it protected at all times; (b) change your
        password periodically; and (c) create passwords that are at least 8 characters in length and a combination of
        lower case and capitalized letters, numbers and symbols.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Please note that despite all precautionary steps, no data transmission over the Internet can be
        guaranteed to be 100% secure. Fastbee HandyMan will use commercially reasonable measures to protect your information
        but does not warrant that the information transmitted to us will be secure at all times. Please do not provide
